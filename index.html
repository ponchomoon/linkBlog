                <li>What went well? Key Learning: The key to learning in web development is perseverance, discipline and self-motivation. it requires doing examples every day, coding and learning new commands. I have learned the process of searching blogs and pages for the answers to the errors that have appeared in each of my attempts to create a web page.</li> <br>
                <li>What could have been improved? We know that true learning is not about memorizing. What's more, most of what is memorized is lost in a matter of hours. To retain what they have been taught, students must assimilate the content by constructing meanings in different ways, and making use of our own skills; in other words, we must encourage them to be the protagonists of their learning process. This is why I need to apply the concepts learned to new pages and try to improve the exercises previously carried out.</li> <br>
                <li>The key take aways: 
                    <ol type="a">
                    <li>Drink water:
                            This liquid is vital for your learning, if you are a woman it is recommended that you drink about 2.7 liters and for men, it is about 3.7 liters; 20% of water consumption occurs through food.
                            
                           </li>
                        <li> Exercise the body:
                            By doing a little exercise we produce endorphins and hormones, we also increase neurotransmitters, all this allows us to be in a good mood, have good energy levels, and we can be more attentive; This translates into better learning ability.</li>
                        <li>Sleep:Lack of sleep reduces the ability to react to stressful situations, you can become frustrated faster than you reason, and even the easiest problems can be difficult to solve.</li>
                        <li>Stress reduction strategies:By doing activities that are to your liking, resting a little, surrounding yourself with people you appreciate, as well as expressing your feelings, they help to lower your stress levels, do not hesitate to apply them.</li>
                        </ol>
                </li> <br>
                <li>The process you followed?: my learning process in web development has been approximately four months. When I started I only followed internet tutorials without understanding what I was doing but I did not give up, at this point in the process I already have commands and basic concepts clear in my mind. I am studying a boot code with Academy Xi and this blog is part of one of my activities. </li> <br>
